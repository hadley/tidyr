\title{Pivot data from wide to long.}
\usage{
pivot_long(df, cols, names_to = "name", values_to = "value",
  spec = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, ptype = list())

pivot_long_spec(df, cols, names_to = "name", values_to = "value")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame to pivot.}

\item{cols}{Columns to pivot into longer format. This takes a tidyselect
specification.}

\item{names_to, values_to}{This pair of arguments determine which columns
the data stored in the column names (\code{names_to}) and the data stored in
the cell values (\code{values_to}) turn into in the result.

Note that these variables do not exist, so must be specified as strings.}

\item{spec}{Alternatively, instead of providing \code{cols} (and \code{names_to} and
\code{values_to}) you can parse a specification data frame. This is useful
for more complex pivots because it gives you greater control on how
metadata stored in the column names turns into columns in the result.

Must be a data frame containing character \code{.name} and \code{.value} columns.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{TRUE}, will drop rows that contain only \code{NA}s in the
\code{value_to} column. This effectively converts explicit missing values to
implicit missing values, and should generally be used only when missing
values in \code{df} were created by its structure.}

\item{ptype}{If not specified, the type of the \code{value_to} column will be
automatically guess from the data. Supply this argument when you want to
override that default. Should be a named list, where the names are
given by the value columns.}

\description{
\code{pivot_long()} "lengthens" data, increasing the number of rows and
decreasing the number of columns. See more details in \code{vignette("pivot")},
and see \code{\link[=pivot_wide]{pivot_wide()}} for the inverse transformation.
}
\details{
\code{pivot_long} is a generalisation of the function \code{gather}, it differs from
\code{gather} in two ways:

1: It's designed to be easier to read and use. Years of user feedback has
made it clear that the name of \code{gather} is not intuitive and users
(including \code{tidyr} developers) refer to the documentation almost every time
they use the function.

2: \code{pivot_long} has been inspired by new features in other R packages, it's
therefore more powerful and flexible than \code{gather}.

However, \code{gather} will never be deprecated. For detailed examples of how to
use \code{pivot_long}, consult the vigentte
\code{vignette("pivot", package = "tidyr")}
}
