\title{Standard-evaluation version of \code{separate}.}
\usage{
separate_(data, col, into, sep = "[^[:alnum:]]+", remove = TRUE,
  convert = FALSE, extra = "warn", fill = "warn", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{col}{Name of column to split, as string.}

\item{into}{Names of new variables to create as character vector.}

\item{sep}{Separator between columns.

  If character, is interpreted as a regular expression. The default
  value is a regular expression that matches any sequence of
  non-alphanumeric values.

  If numeric, interpreted as positions to split at. Positive values start
  at 1 at the far-left of the string; negative value start at -1 at the
  far-right of the string. The length of \code{sep} should be one less than
  \code{into}.}

\item{remove}{If \code{TRUE}, remove input column from output data frame.}

\item{convert}{If \code{TRUE}, will run \code{\link{type.convert}} with
\code{as.is = TRUE} on new columns. This is useful if the component
columns are integer, numeric or logical.}

\item{extra}{If \code{sep} is a character vector, this controls what
  happens when there are too many pieces. There are three valid options:

  \itemize{
   \item "warn" (the default): emit a warning and drop extra values.
   \item "drop": drop any extra values without a warning.
   \item "merge": only splits at most \code{length(into)} times
  }}

\item{fill}{If \code{sep} is a character vector, this controls what
  happens when there are not enough pieces. There are three valid options:

  \itemize{
   \item "warn" (the default): emit a warning and fill from the right
   \item "right": fill with missing values on the right
   \item "left": fill with missing values on the left
  }}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link{strsplit}} to control
how the regular expression is processed.}
