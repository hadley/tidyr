This guide serves two distinct-but-related purposes:

  * Recommend best practices to maintainers of external packages that depend on tidyr. This is inspired by a similar guide in the development version of ggplot2: [Using ggplot2 in packages](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/ggplot2-in-packages.html).
  * Describe migration patterns for the transition from tidyr v0.8.3 to v1.0.0. This is a more time-dependent topic, but is handled here because it has considerable overlap with the first point.
