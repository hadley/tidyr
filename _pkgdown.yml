- title: Pivotting
  description: |
    tidyr provides three families of tools for changing the form of a dataset,
    while preserving its values:
    * Pivotting, which changes the representation of a rectangular dataset.
      See `vignette("pivot")` for more details.
    * Rectangling, which turns deeply nested lists into tidy tibbles.
      See `vignette("rectangle")` for more details.
    * Nesting and unnesting, which support converstaion to and from an
      alternative representation of grouped data where a group becomes a
      single row containing a nested data frame. See `vignette("nest")`
      for more details.
